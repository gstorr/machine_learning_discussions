      "I agree with you. I am a Chinese contributor to this site and I speak 3 Chinese vernaculars and 3 European languages and through some of the unreasonable Mandarinization imposed here, I feel how repressed non-native Mandarin speakers are by those apparently native speakers. Traditionally, foreign names are transliterated into Chinese ideographs by whichever vernacular group that first settled there. In USA and Europe, it is mostly by the Cantonese, then subsequently The Minnan-Taiwanese and recently the people for Fuzhou, Wenzhou etc. As such, they will use Han ideographs to represent the sounds they transliterate from the foreign language like English. There is no standardised version until the Northerners came into power and imposed Mandarin on all the other Chinese groups for the noble mission of reuniting the motherland against foreign invaders through bettering communication. I think the best way to transliterate and reflect the diversity of Chinese culture is to put the actual foreign name first, i.e. the ORIGINAL, followed by the oldest transliteration (in chronology) and finally the Mandarin version. That will make it easy for everyone cos then the eyes will zoom right to the end for the contemporary Mandarin pronunciation and zoom right to the first line for the original and if readers have time, they can trace the colorful history of transliteration and migration by reading the chronology of changes. Thank you for being so interested in Chinese culture. We need more friends like you. Have a nice day.\n",

      "Answer to  \n",
      "i) \"\"your arguments are very biased and unethical.\"\". You took sentences that suit you from different documents to make a point without revealing the conclusion/true intentions of the author in your sources.\n",
      "ANSWER: I directly wrote what is written in the resolutions and books. The title of the heading \"\"The LEGAL ASPECTS of Turkey's 1974 Action \"\" cannot prevent you put the resolutions/sources that indicate the operation as illegal.\n",
      "\n",
      "ii) Why didn't you write the whole thing?\n",
      "ANS: In the book, it wrote: \"\"the member states did not maintain this view after the second round of military operations\"\" is not something that is related with PACE. The views of the member states of a particular organization (here: PACE) does not bind the organization itself unless there is a resolution is made in that organization. \n",
      "\n",
      "iii) \"\"The Resolution of the U.N Security Council and General Assembly indicate that the Turkish invasion was an illegal act...\"\" in contrast with your other argument that \"\"there is no UN resolution that calls the Turkey's 1974 action as \"\"invasion\"\". \n",
      "ANS: Here, in this sentence, \"\"indicate that the Turkish INVASION was an illegal act..\"\" is a naming that is done by the author, not the UN Security Council. What is binding in UN is the UN SC as you may know. And, once again, I am backing my writing: \"\"There is no UN resolution that calls the Turkey's 1974 action as \"\"invasion\"\". If you claim otherwise, just put a resolution no/date so that we are all behind you at this point. Here is the whole UN SC resolutions: UN Resolutions. Which one of them calls the intervention as INVASION? No one! \n",
      "\n",
      "iv) Kareklas concludes: \"\"Nevertheless, having regard to the EQUALLY POWERFUL ARGUEMENTS militating against unilateral armed INTERVENTION envisaged by treaty, it may be clearly concluded that Turkey SHOULD NOT HAVE EXERCISED A RIGHT OF INTERVENTION in Cyprus, 1974; however, such a proposition could remain subject to criticism, in view of the peculiarities of the Cyprus issue\"\" \n",
      "ANS: Even the Greek Kareklas uses the word \"\"INTERVENTION\"\" as you see. Dear , \"\"SHOULD NOT HAVE EXERCISED A RIGHT OF INTERVENTION\"\" even demonstrates the legality of the intervention (the fact I empasized about the legality of operation in that aspect). \"\"SHOULD NOT HAVE EXERCISED A RIGHT OF INTERVENTION\"\" means that \"\"THERE IS A RIGHT OF INTERVENTION\"\" but \"\"IT WOULD BE NICE IF THAT RIGHT WAS NOT USED AND THE ISSUE WAS SOLVED BY OTHER MEANS\"\". , if you do not understand in this way, you should develop your English.\n",
      "\n",
      "v) In 1979, JUST AFTER 5 YEARS LATER THE OPERATION, The GREECE's Athens Court of Appeals: \"\"The Turkish military intervention in Cyprus...was LEGAL.\"\" Here, GREECE's court did not distinguish between the 1st phase (20-22July1974) and 2nd phase (14-16August1974) of the operation. In 1979, both of the first and second operation already finished 5 years ago. GREECE's court, hence, thought legal situation of both of the operations, in advance of making any decision about the 1974 war. , in the sentence \"\"The Turkish military intervention in Cyprus...was LEGAL.\"\", do you find any separation about both phase of the operations? \n",
      "\n",
      "vi) So... dear , as you see, I did not take the specific parts of the sources in part. The title \"\"The Legal Aspects of Turkey's 1974 Action\"\" does not prevent you to find and write illegal aspects of the operation as well. You are welcome to state this. As long as these are not the parts of the interested parties, you can be sure that the sources you will find will be welcome. As you see, I directly write the text of PACE's resolution. PACE is not one of the two parties. I directly write the text of the decision of the GREECE's court. Here, GREECE's court certainly is a party, but indicates opinion/decision just opposite to GREECE's government.  That is, you should show sources i) not a party (neutral source) ii) one of the parties but express opposite view to the party (in which it is located) itself.  \"\n",

JHP, if you're talking about the 14:54, 27 June 2007 24.209.30.113 (edit #141014976) entry that I reverted, it is because the content was taken directly from the Incidents page without any regard for either (a) including the references themselves, or (b) not following the WP:BLP policy that was taking place over on that page regarding this specific incident.  If you're talking about the 22:32, 2 July 2007 Realkyhick (edit #142152748) entry that I reverted, it's because the entry contained information that was already outdated by information that was updated in the Incidents page, and the link to the Incidents page was also removed by Realkyhick at that time.  If you're talking about your edit #147620955 from the 29th, that was just a copy of the same info from the Incidents page, poorly included, and badly placed in the article  while we all agree that there should be some mention of the incident, including it in the intro section isn't really appropriate either, especially as it (in essence) duplicated information that was posted further down the page.

      "GoodDay, the countries category is called just that, not 'Independant countries'. Wales, Scotland and England are countries (NI is not, but that's another matter). As they are countries they belong in the countries category, perfectly logically. In any case, this has been discussed repeatedly and the consensus is - as if we needed to be told! - that they are countries. Despite my opposition to the inclusion of the Six Counties - English Wikipedia has followed the political line of the New Labour UK government, a lie line which is contrary to the Belfast Agreement - I am tempted to agree with the compromise 'Category:Countries of the United Kingdom' but would like to hear other people's opinion as well. It's disappointing and somewhat surprising that such a significant change has attracted so little comment. Perhaps what we really need here in the long term is a clearer practical distinction between the terms 'country' and 'sovereign state'. BritishWatcher says above that he \"\"supported and accepted the fact England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland should be called countries\"\" but opposes them \"\"appearing on lists of countries (where only sovereign states are listed)\"\". Therein lies the nub of the problem - the argument that although E, S and W are in fact countries they should not be listed as countries: talk about Alice in Wonderland!   \"\n",

By construting Israeli settlements on Palestinian land, Israel is in violation of Article 49, paragraph 6 of the Fourth Geneva Convention which prohibit the occupying power from transfering its own civilians to occupied territory. This is not disputed by the UN or the international community. In addition, Israel is in violation of UN resolution 242, the 2002 UN , on Torture, as well as other well documented human rights abuses. To not mention these at all and to just point the finger at the Palestinians for violating international law does a great disservice to this article and makes it have a very biased POV.

What Prashad is actually addressing here (and in other writings) is his opposition to Hindu nationalists in India and their developing relationship to Jewish Lobby groups as well as to the Likud. Prashad's discussion is not scholarly, it is purely polemical, and he is attempting to minimize the influence of the lobby in order to undercut the Hindu right wing's alliance with them and with (at the time) Sharon. Elsewhere, Prashad, an intellectual leader of the Communist Party of India-Marxist, has argued that the Jewish Lobby cant be powerful because to think so \"\"does not sit well for a Marxist framework.\"\" Hence Prashad has been arguing that the strength of Sharonism is what's key in US support for Israel, not the JL. Given the polemical character of Prahshad's piece and it's peripheral relationship to the actual history of the JL, and the fact that his quote is lifted out of context from what he is actually discussing/polemicizing presenting (the CPI-M line), and regardless of what one makes of his argument, this is way too weighty.   \"\n",

I cannot find any reputable source claiming he is anything more than a field commander in northern Syria. He doesn't even feature in any IS leadership hierarchies, which are almost exclusively staffed by Iraqis who have been in the organisations since the early-mid 2000's. When the former commander of the IS Military Council passed away in June 2014 (Abu Abdulrahman al-Bilawi), Iraqi secutyi forces found some memory sticks and a laptop containing the following leadership information currently pieced together by western analysts. Note how al-Shishani doesn't feature in any of them, save one which turned out to be incorrect. Here they are: , , . Here is the false one which showed al-Shishani succeeding al-Bilawi as the IS military chief of the Military Shura: . However, it was Abu Ayman al-Iraqi, another IS Iraqi commander who had been in the organisation years before al-Shishani had joined who succeeded al-Bilawi as the Chief of the Military Shura. He is shown in the graph as Adnan Latif Hamid al-Sweidawi which is his real name. You never see the upper echelons of the IS hierarchy, the ones who actually control everything.

It only matters for the academic exercise of trying to create a function centered at n=0 whose DTFT is real-valued.

Rom. p. 277 D and 278 E, by means of a freedman of Spurius Carvilius Ruga, about the beginning of the second Punic war) a slight graphic alteration was made in the C, which introduced into the Roman orthography the letter G (on the old monuments C); thus we have in the S. C. de Bacchanal.: MAGISTER, MAGISTRATVM, FIGIER, GNOSCIER, AGRO; on the other hand, the orthography GNAIVOD PATRE PROGNATVS on the first Epitaph of the Scipios, which dates before that time, indicates either incorrectness in the copying or a later erection of the monument.\n",

      "First, I think it was SatuSuro who made the version about the Faith that is now on the page, and would like to thank him for his research and work. Both of the quotes I have added are verifiable, I can post the references again if necessary; they are not original research; they are also impartial in presenting the Faith's teachings because they do not attempt to sway a person one way or another about what to believe about them but rather present them directly because they ARE the teaching. Anyone elses summary of them could only be inaccurate. There are no major disputes as far as I am aware about the Baha'i teachings about the life of the soul after death. This summary of the Wikipedia article about a neutral point of view I believe is exactly what applies here:\n",
      "\n",
      "When we discuss an opinion, we attribute the opinion to someone and discuss the fact that they have this opinion. For instance, rather than asserting that \"\"The Beatles were the greatest band ever\"\", locate a source such as Rolling Stone magazine and say: \"\"Rolling Stone said that the Beatles were the greatest band ever\"\", and include a reference to the issue in which that statement was made. Likewise, the statement \"\"Most people from Liverpool believe that the Beatles were the greatest band ever\"\" can be made if it can be supported by references to a particular survey; a claim such as \"\"The Beatles had many songs that made the UK Singles Chart\"\" can also be made, because it is verifiable as fact. The first statement asserts a personal opinion; the second asserts the fact that an opinion exists and attributes it to reliable sources.\n",
      "\n",
      "Also, the Baha'i Faith has been consistently among the top three fastest growing religions in the world for about the last fifty years. There is sufficient public interest in it for it to be given due consideration on the basis of some other factor, and size and general public knowledge about the Faith are the only two factors remaining that I am aware of. As the Faith is growing faster than public knowledge can keep up with it it should not be considered solely from the point of view of the academic community, so the only impartial test for how much consideration it should be given compared to other religions would be its size, which is estimated at seven to ten million followers worldwide based on the most recent statistics and statements from the Baha'i World Center. Judaism has approximately fourteen million followers world-wide.\"\n",

To quote Jacob Bronowski: \"\"One aim of the physical sciences has been to give an exact picture of the material world. One achievement of physics in the twentieth century has been to prove that that aim is unattainable. The world is not a fixed, solid array of objects, out there, for it cannot be fully separated from out perception of it. There is no absolute knowledge. And those who claim it, whether they are scientists or dogmatists open the door to tragedy. All information is imperfect. We have to treat it with humility. That is the human condition.” J Bronowski – The Ascent of Man  \n",

      "\n",
      "The concept and game of K.M.F. was first commissioned by Courtney Porcella—resident of the City of Sin, Lynn, MA—in the early twenty first century in the United States of America, more specifically Massachusetts.  Spreading initially as “Kill-Marry-Fuck” between her and her close friends, this game quickly spread throughout the fourth floor of Donahue at Suffolk University, the school she currently attends.  Although this game quickly manifested itself into a game of pastime, it has never reached its full potential as an ice breaker due to the lingering question of its social acceptability.\n",
      "\n",
      "Prior to the spring of 2010, K.M.F. was referred to as its founding name, “Kill-Marry-Fuck.”  The cause of the name change was brought on by a Senator from Suffolk University’s Student Government Association.  The main reason behind the move for the change was to reflect the professionalism of the student leaders occupying the offices on the fourth floor of Donahue.  Although K.M.F. was never targeted specifically, people got the message from the Senator and changed its name respectively.\n",
      "\n",
      "Regardless of the name change, K.M.F. never lost it original essence, Donahue’s pastime.  And the name change now allows players to play K.M.F. in all types of atmosphere, ranging from weddings to preschool school.  Less than a year after the publicizing of K.M.F., this game has expanded to Boston’s neighboring cities.\n",
      "\n",
      "At the time, Ms. Porcella has no disclosed plans to spread K.M.F. statewide or nationally.\n",

India has a larger PPP GDP, but Russia has a much higher per capita GDP than India in both categories. Overall, Russia has a higher HDI index.

Also, India has a higher GDP growth rate than Russia (see List of countries by GDP (real) growth rate) and according to BRIC report, India's GDP (nominal) will be four times that of Russia's by 2050 and that is a very important factor considering this is an article on potential superpowers.   \n",

There are many reasons why Russia is a superpower and that is a long discussion. Russia is the number military forces in the world and the worlds largest military arsenal builder.

I also noticed that there are many facts added to the present article; others understandbly taken out.)  Rev. Al doesn't make reference to this affiliation in any detail in his auto-bio, but that is his and his editors privelge of discrecton in such tomes:  What is not said is left for others to investigate.  What his involvement with RYM is something that the Good Reverend, the F.B.I. as well as other police agencies scrutinizing Al for the past 35-yrs, LaRouche,et al, and perhaps some of the surviving members of RYM to attest.

      "One Direction (commonly abbreviated as 1D) are an English-Irish pop boy band based in London, comprising Niall Horan, Liam Payne, Harry Styles and Louis Tomlinson. Zayn Malik was formerly a member leaving the band on March 25th 2015. They signed with Simon Cowell's record label Syco Records after forming and finishing third in the seventh series of the British televised singing competition The X Factor in 2010. Propelled to international success by social media, One Direction's four albums, Up All Night (2011), Take Me Home (2012), Midnight Memories (2013) and Four (2014) broke records, topped charts in most major markets, and generated hit singles including \"\"What Makes You Beautiful\"\", \"\"Live While We're Young\"\", \"\"Story of My Life\"\" and \"\"Steal My Girl\"\".\n",
      "\n",
      "Their achievements include five Brit Awards, four MTV Video Music Awards, eleven MTV Europe Music Awards, and nineteen Teen Choice Awards out of nineteen nominations, among many others. According to Nick Gatfield, the chairman and chief executive of Sony Music Entertainment UK, One Direction represented a $50 million business empire by June 2012. They were proclaimed 2012's \"\"Top New Artist\"\" by Billboard. According to the Sunday Times Rich List, by April 2013, they had an estimated personal combined wealth of £25 million ($41.2m) making them the second-wealthiest musicians in the UK under 30 years of age. In 2014, Forbes listed them the second-highest earning celebrities under 30, with the group earning an estimated $75 million from June 2013 to June 2014.\"\"Justin Bieber is Forbes' highest-earning celebrity under 30 pocketing $80m this year... which should just about cover his costly legal woes\"\".

Typically, they're less controversial cases, so one judge's clerk writes the opinion, then they're circulated for comment. But the other judges typically don't scrutinize it as closely as if their name was on the line; there are many examples of judges railing against dicta that they theoretically endorsed just a couple of years earlier—sometimes even within the same case.

Incidently, Netherton is certainly not part of Dudley Town (although it is in Dudley MBC). There are a number of historical and geographical reasons to support the separate nature of Netherton town (I would be pleased to elaborate if requested) but it is clear from the local press (such as Dudley News), local historians (see Ned Williams above), and local government and transport organisations, that Netherton is regarded as separate from Dudley Town.\n",

      "Hi, thanks for your thoughts. I have to disagree about your disambiguity-argument. You say \"\"Germany\"\" can refer to either \"\"West Germany\"\" or \"\"East Germany\"\". This is - as I already stated - simply not correct, since there never was a country named \"\"West Germany\"\" and there never was a country named \"\"East Germany\"\", they were called those names in foreign media for simplicity reasons, as the \"\"Federal Republic of Germany\"\" was part of the western capitalist world or first world, while the \"\"Peoples Republic of Germany\"\" was part of Eastern bloc, or second world. Still this is not the correct term for the country, and is therefore no phrasing for an encyclopaedia. It is colloquial language that saves time, but still this doesn't make it the correct term. I do not make up names or use other possibly derogatory terms for other countries, and therefore would prefer, if wikipaedia articles are kept in a neutral tone too. So if there is really confusion to avoid, then the only correct way to do so, is to use the complete names of the country, and not some popular slang. To be honest, i didn't think there would be a confusion, and someone might think this final was between the Peoples Republic of Germany and England, and not between the Federal Republic of Germany and England (since the Peoples Republic of Germany only participated in one World Cup anyways). But that's probably me knowing already a lot about this topic and forgetting about people that know little about World Cup history, so i might be wrong. But if others do think the distinction is necessary, then please distinguish the teams with the real names of the country and not colloquial language. Finally i want to point out, that the link to Germany National Footbal Team leads to an article that already explains, that there were temporary governing football associations other than the DFB, so if there really is a confusion which German team this is, a click on the link of the team name will resolve that confusion.\n",
      "\n",
      "Your second argument is, that \"\"most sources refer to that team as West Germany\"\". That may be right, but is that really the deciding criterion? If i find, that most sources say, that eg Evolution is wrong, and Intelligent Design is right, will that decide the content of a wikipaedia article? I know it's a bad example, and i don't want to provoke a political or offtopic discussion, i just want to make to point that what many people say is not necessarily right. But unlike in discussions about \"\"most sources say Britney Spears is the best singer of all times\"\" this whole thing is not up to taste, political views, scientific surveys, or speculations. It is simply a fact, that the name of the country this team represents is not \"\"West Germany\"\", so it is not right to call the football team that represents this country \"\"West Germany\"\". If you don't believe that this is a fact, then look it up on every government document of the Federal Republic of Germany, the name \"\"West Germany\"\" is never used. And btw: it is not like, there is no source using the proper name of the team. It may not be the majority (i don't know tbh), but i am confident, that i can find a sizeable number of references using the correct term, which will be enough for every passage of this article. German sources use the correct term anyways, i could bombard you with thousands of sources in German language that use \"\"Germany\"\" or \"\"FRG\"\" or \"\"BRD\"\", and not \"\"West Germany\"\". At the end it is the souvereign right of a country to name herself (see also Macedonia vs Greece) and in English the \"\"Bundesrepublik Deutschland\"\" has the official name \"\"Federal Republic of Germany\"\" - or short \"\"Germany\"\" - and has never called herself or referred to itself as \"\"West Germany\"\", or \"\"Federal Republic of West Germany\"\" or any other alteration including geographical terms. And the governing body of German football since 1900, the \"\"Deutscher Fußballbund\"\" which translates into \"\"German Football Association\"\" has never called itself \"\"West German Football Association\"\" or referred to its players as \"\"West Germans\"\". As i have already mentioned above, all Germans were eligble to play, whether they are from east or west or south or north. Even Germans born in other countries are eligible, like Paolo Rink born in Brazil, or Miroslav Klose/Lukas Podolski/Piotr Trochowski born in Poland, or Oliver Neuville born in Switzerland, as long as they have German ancestry. \n",
      "\n",
      "It is and was the explicit objective of the DFB to represent all Germans. This is exemplified when the Federal Republic of Germany played in eastern Europe, thousands came from the Peoples Republic of Germany to support the team from the other side of the Iron Curtain. They did that even though the Peoples Republic of Germany over time started penalizing people who support the \"\"class enemy\"\" from across the border.

      "How much money was exchanged for this interview? And was this interview constructed to conflict prison officer Pascoe's claim that he fired a shot that killed Hodson? In the opinion of this nun, Ryan no longer wanted to live. But this nun was not a psychologist, so how could she possibly come to that conclusion?  \n",
      "Obviously, it seems Ryan's execution was more of a state-assisted suicide. \n",
      "In relation to this alleged confession, Ryan didn't actually say he shot Hodson, but allegedly, said he shot to wing not to kill. Ryan,  obviously in an extremely confused mental state, (as any person would be prior to being killed by the Government), could have been talking about his past kangaroo shooting events or any other event for that matter. After all, a mentally confused person does not talk in a rational manner. \n",
      "Besides, nobody else close to Ryan claimed he no longer wanted to live. None of Ryan's family members claim he said such a thing. In any case, any person who states they no longer wish to live should be immediately evaluated for mental illness, So, why wasn't a psychiatrist called to treat Ryan for possible mental disorders, depression and suicidal thoughts? Why the push to execute Ryan if he was mentally unstable, hence, no longer wanted to live?\n",
      "Legal professionals will confirm that alleged confessions and alleged verbals are not legally acceptable as \"\"evidence of guilt\"\". Many prisoners have been later aquitted of murder after allegations of verbals and confessions. There must be scientific forensic evidence to prove guilt beyond reasonable doubt. In Ryan's case there was none - nothing! To make aftermath allegations against Ryan, decades after his execution when he cannot defend himself, are vile, immoral, unethical and complete mockery to the justice system, to the dead Ryan, and to his innocent family members. The police corruption uncovered by various Australian Royal Commissions is enough to question the validity of Ryan's alleged verbals.\n",
      "Why would Ryan make all these alleged confessions, then in the eleventh-hour write to various people; I state most emphatically that I am not guilty of murder\"\" In addition, Father Brosnan put an end to all these aftermath unproven and unconfirmed allegations in February 2003, when he was interviewed on ABC National Radio, shortly before his death. Father Brosnan always believed Ryan was innocent.  \n",

      "I have recently found a 1979 booklet of questions and answers with Rawat printed and distributed by Divine Light Mission, Inc. which bears heavily on some of the issues central to this article.  This document was published at least five years after the family split, seven or eight years after Rawat came to the west and when he was either 21 or 22 years old.  In other words, at the time he uttered these statements, he was an adult who was long familiar with western culture, spoke good English and was very much his own man.  Here are a few of the questions and answers:\n",

      "Some people say you are a divine incarnation, and some people say other things about you.  What's the truth?\n",

Electricity cannot give light, only the bulb gives light, but electricity has to be put through the wire for the bulb to give light.  It's power.  Power cannto do anything.

You can't drink that water.  It is a picture.  You need everything living.  If you have doubts, you cannot ask Lord Krishna questions.  What's why you need a living Master for the circumstances of this world today.  When Jesus was here there were no nuclear bombs.

They stop being plastic.  They become natural and the best way of ending disease is by nature.\n",

When people were looking for sophisticated discourses, I spoke of simple things. When people wanted nirvana, I said, \"\"You need peace.\"\" When people said, \"\"Tell us of the scriptures,\"\" I said, \"\"Look within you.\"\" When people asked, \"\"What is your qualification?\"\" I said, \"\"Judge me by what I offer.\"\" To this day, some people see me the way they want to.

There was a these written on that as far back as 1950: Frank Parrella, “Lebensraum and Manifest Destiny: A Comparative Study in the Justification of  Expansionism” . There's also Reginald Horsman, Race and Manifest Destiny. Ward Churchill makes comparisons between lebenraum and American attitudes to Indians in his books, notably A Little Matter of Genocide: Holocaust and Denial in the Americas.   \"\n",

      " As I said above, Deep learning is the name of a class of algorithms. Feedforward neural nets, restricted Boltzmann machines, deep neural networks and deep belief networks are all mathematical models. How the models are trained, that is, how model parameters are chosen to optimize some loss function, is another topic entirely. People had looked at deep neural network architectures before deep learning techniques were developed, but it was the deep learning techniquesunsupervised pre-training, layer by layerthat made deep networks more practical at the time. With today's GPU based algorithms, the need for pre-training has lessened. The hype surrounding deep learning has muddied the concept to point that people like Michael Jordan claim it is just a synonym for neural network. But the backlash from current hype doesn't change the historical importance of deep learning algorithms in generating interest and good results in deep neural network models or representational learning. Schmidhuber's review has a good discussion of these issues.   21:55\n",

      "\"::I am surprised you dispute whether or not the Analects contain music criticism when this is so widely written about. Your criticism of Steben’s 2010 paper, “The Philosophy of Music and Ritual in Pre-Han Confucian Thought” http://www.academia.edu/1929545/The_Philosophy_of_Music_and_Ritual_in_Pre-Han_Confucian_Thought_Exalting_the_Power_of_Music_in_Human_Life) for not using the word “criticism” is as unsupportable as your insistence on the word “theory.” Lest we devolve into absurd arguments about the definition of “criticism,” In general, the word is defined as “The action of criticizing, or passing judgment on the qualities or merits of anything….” (The Philological Society, ed. The Oxford English Dictionary, Vol II C, Oxford at the Clarendon Press, 1970, p.1181). With regard to music specifically, “The Oxford Companion to Music” defines it, in specific regard to music, as: “…the intellectual activity of formulating judgments on the value and degree of excellence of individual works of music, or whole groups or genres.”(Latham, ed. Oxford University Press, 2002, p.324) Steben’s paper then clearly describes Confucius’ criticism. As another example, WP’s article on Yayue refers to Confucius’ writing: “The term yayue itself first appeared in the Analects,[2][3] where yayue was considered by Confucius to be the kind of music that is good and beneficial, in contrast to the popular music originated from the state of Zheng which he judged to be decadent and corrupting.[4][5] Yayue is therefore regarded in the Confucian system as the proper form of music that is refined, improving, and essential for self-cultivation, and one that can symbolize good and stable governance.[6][7] “ The Analects contain music criticism whether the word “criticism” appears or not. I think you may be the only person around who thinks otherwise. In the future, if you make assertions like, “You claim that \"\"Confucius' Analects is, in regard to music, criticism\"\"; but the reference that you quote in support of your claim utterly fails to actually support it, because it merely never speaks of criticism,” please cite a reference to support your argument. Your continuing argument that a thing cannot be accepted as theoretical unless it specifically uses the word “theory” is similarly problematic because it is not supported anywhere that I can find. Throughout or discussion, I’ve pointed you to references that contradict your personal opinion. If you have a reference for your opinion, please cite. Jacques Bailhé \n",

[2] As a result, many older works of art that used lead paint now show some discoloration.\"\"\n",

Artists working in transparent watercolor (aquarelle) don't usually use white paint, or just occasionally a bit of \"\"Chinese White\"\" (not lead) to make corrections. And opaque watercolors (gouache) and acrylic (polymer) artist's paints typically use titanium dioxide or (rarely) zinc white, but never lead. Normally \"\"flake white\"\" is used only by oil painters, and there's no indication in the study that they were referring to oil paints. Cooperstown is a well-respected institution, but as of now I'm sticking with the classic (Ralph Mayer). Flake white may get *slightly* yellowish after centuries, but nothing like the gross discoloration referred to in the paragraph above.

She says that, according to what she was told, it sells on Amazon for 50 USD/48 EUR and that she would send me a link from the Barnes&Noble; website. There are several issues here: first, both she and I don't think it's ethical to publish any kind of biography of a living person without notifying the person (and at least her business address is widely known). Secondly, and which has to do directly with Wikipedia, both she and I don't believe that one can, just like that, copy &paste; content that is made available for free and make profit out of it (how much of this book did the authors actually work for? we don't know, because we don't have it yet; but they take pride in \"\"basing\"\" it on wp which  is not a good sign).\n",

With a different name but same line-up, they recorded in 1995 the mini cd Opinion About Sorrow released by Torture Records. The mini cd contained 5 tracks of original and strange brutal death-metal.

From the old line-up Andrea and Max were still there. After recording a 2 tracks promo with the new line up (Massimo - guitar, Marcello - drums, Edo - bass) and the track Molesting The Corpse for the underground splatter movie Sick-o-pathic soundtrack. The band played as support for Cannibal Corpse and Immolation for a show in Rome. Corpsefucking Art recorded their debut CD named A Puzzle Of Flesh for the italian label Sterminio Productions. Nine tracks of blasting ultrabrutal death-metal without mercy. An inhuman voice and a blasting riffing made A Puzzle Of Flesh known in the underground.\n",

Just to add to this, the most recent ofstead report strongly emphasises the need for student and teacher relationships to improve. however, because of the senior staff all living in the 1930's, they took this to mean they need to enforce the rules more, with stronger emphasis on uniform and weaker emphasis on educational support; this has simply degraded student's relationships with their teachers (especially the so - called \"\"senior staff\"\" who don't even teach but instead spend their time punishing people for petty things - the school even employs a certain member of staff whose job it is to be horrible - ironically she is actually called Mrs Horride!) even further.\n",

However, you should also appreciate that not every scholar and certainly not the ultra traditionalist Serer who wants nothing to do with Egypt agree with Diop and in fact his thesis were rebutted by several scholars including Schuh, etc.  These are relevant view points which should also be taken into account in other to avoid bias.  \n",

      "Since they were built by the Serers, and evidence have shown that they are built well before the 14th century, how then could the Serers have migrated into the area into the 14th century?

Now the Serers may have migrated to from the Nile Valley as implied by Henri Gravrand in “La Civilisation Sereer, Pangool”, which is one of the sources cited in the article,  but as noted by Gravrand, if they did came from the Nile it was more than 5 thousand years ago and certainly not the 14th century. Further, as demonstrated by Gamble, Salmon and Njie, the Serer are the oldest inhabitants of Senegambia, others later moved in.  This backs up archealogical source, backs up Gravrand, Kleine, Richard  and so on.  \n",

Even the Wolofs were already present long before the 14th century never mind the Serer people who have been present for thousand of years. Further as substantiated in the article with credible sources which all backs up each other, the Almoravid wars on Takrur due to religion (Islam) led to the Serers of Takrur who were finally defeated in Battle to leave Takrur and headed south.  That was in the 11th century during Abu-Bakr Ibn-Umar and War Jabi.  Even those “Takrurien” Serers came south long before the 14th century to join their other Serer relatives (See Daggs).\n",

In other cases I might disagree that a couple particular quotes are on target.  These two, I happen to agree with. Including both of them is supported by consensus, and WD is part of our consensus, which is why I'm reverting your removal of von Spakovsky immediately, Xeno. ACORN employees across the country have been indicted and convicted for voter registration fraud. The House bill specifies organizations involved in election-related scandals as targets of defunding. For these reasons, the commentary of a former FEC member like von Spakovsky is very valuable. This is his area of expertise. I don't know why you insist on including a lengthy quote from Kenneth R. Thomas, while erasing any mention of the opinion of a former member of the FEC, but I can guess. Skoal.\n",

I do appreciate that its location is already described in the lead as crossing between things X and Y but if you don't already know Stockton well (or recently!) this is not necessarily all that helpful. I was wondering if you could write a more bottom-up description which says something like \"\"the bridge crosses the Tees at blah (or near Blah Street etc); it is A hundred metres downstream from the Foo Bridge and B hundred metres upstream from the Bar Barrage\"\" or whatever, which it seems to me would nail it in more empirical terms. What do you think? Any yes, of course the maps link does nail it (assuming the co-ordinates are right!) but something in the text which helps in this way would, I think, be very useful. I may be being unusually thick  (happens all the time, actually) but on my first reading - and I was last in Stockton in 2007, you see - I was not at all sure where it was, wondering if in fact it replaced the other rather nice pedestrian bridge closer to the town centre. I cured this uncertainty by looking at the maps, yes, but the sentence I'm asking for would have given me more direct access to the knowledeg. Go on, please write it for me, you know you want to; and I will go and put the kettle on for you. Thanks and best wishes   \"\n",

      "\n",
      "Timeshifter, your story above is text-book projection, first rate water-muddying, I grant you, but deceit nonetheless. But this follows the pattern of your edits. Your POV is clear throughout. It's pretty simple: you believe this recent Lancet study is the Truth, and, therefore you have to believe that virtually all other sources are way off. IraqBodyCount is a wild underestimate, ILCS is not \"\"legitimate\"\" etc. Basically every edit you've made on all these pages is carefully orchestrated and loaded to lead everyone toward these beliefs. Now you're pissed that I've ever so slightly gotten in the way of your prolific POV-pushing by deleting a miniscule fraction of it, and now you're playing the victim. \n",
      "\n",
      "Let's put that act aside and look at what I've actually deleted. I've reverted basically three things here: \n",
      "\n",
      "1. Lancet page - claims about a supposed \"\"ILCS baseline 2002 mortality rate\"\". Fabrications do not belong on wiki pages. I deleted that fabrication. The only \"\"sourced material\"\" I deleted was stuff about Lancet baseline rates that were cited accurately enough, but only had any relevance to this section because they were being related to the fabrication I was removing. Once the fabricated \"\"ILCS baseline rate\"\" is removed, the surrounding \"\"sourced material\"\" from Lancet that I deleted no longer has any relevance to the section. It is entirely out of context and so properly removed along with the fabrication. The \"\"sourced material\"\" that was there makes no sense being there unless the fabrication is there, so I removed it along with the fabrication. \n",
      "\n",
      "2. IBC page - I deleted an inaccurate and out of context claim authored by Timeshifter. I added a statement which says IBC showed an example of something, and provided a citation for this. Timeshifter then adds that Lancet authors dispute this claim from IBC, and he puts a footnote onto this, but the footnote leads to quotes by Lancet authors that address something else entirely. Thus, this claim of Timeshifter's is properly removed as it is falsely described as one thing when it is something else, and the citation leads to something that is different than how it's described. \n",
      "\n",
      "So the first two are just simple falsehoods and fabrications. Apparently it's \"\"against the rules\"\" and \"\"POV-favoring\"\" to delete POV-pushing falsehoods and fabrications.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. IBC page - Guatemala study. I've questioned the relevance of this to IBC, and the accuracy of the description, and discussed this on the talk page. This one is at least more debatable than the others, as it is just tangential cherry-picking for a POV, rather than just fabrications and falsehoods for a POV.\n",
      "\n",
      "Deleting these three things has been my great crime, causing poor Timeshifter so much pain and anguish, yeah right. As I've already said, I can't keep up with Timeshifter's proselytizing for the Lancet study on all these various pages. He's very commited to the cause, as proselytizers tend to be.\"\n",

It is also against the Hippocratic Oath; which states: \"\"Do no harm.\"\" Circumcision is harmful to infants and the men that they will become. A circumcision itself takes 1/3 to 1/2 of the male shaft skin on the penis. It also takes over 2000 fine touch nerve sensors, the gentle gliding mechanism that is offered by the foreskin, and the protection of the foreskin itself. It causes unnecessary pain to the infant and the anesthesia does not block all the pain that an infant feels. In 1993, a ban was formed against genital cutting of infant females. Under the law the ban should also cover male infants too as the equal protection act states. It's time for all sexes to be protected from this barbaric practice.\n",

      "- Free oxygen, free fluorine and moisture surely will corrode the metallic walls.  However, the chemical potential of the salt has to be controlled anyway so it is slightly on the reducing side, containing some trivalent uranium.  So any free oxygen or fluorine will oxydize the uranium ions, not the metal structure.  Moisture will be driven out with the off-gas at working temperatures.  All this is pretty much a non-issue.\n",

      "- Cryolithe.  Yes, aluminium is produced by electrolysing alumina with cryolithe.  This can be considered a mixture or solution of sodium flouride, aluminium fluoride and aluminum oxide, certainly a molten salt.  But the cryolithe is really only a fluxing agent, it is chemically non-agressive and it doesn't extract aluminium or something.  You hinted that it does, which  is really misleading.\n",

      "- Heating is not a technological issue.  Sure, it adds to the cost, but other than that there's no problem.  A power reactor would run quite some time without ever being cooled down, refuelling is done by adding some molten or even solid salt, without shutdown, cooling or heating.  \n",
      "\n",
      "- But tritium is a problem.  To slow down tritium formation, the lithium in the salt has to be almost pure Li-7, and even then tritium will form.  Tritium in the salt is no problem, it doesn't attack metals.  Tritium migrating from the salt is a problem.  ORNL says, they were able to chemically trap the tritium in the secondary cooling loop.  A problem, yes, but nothing major.\n",

I don't want to re-open anything like an argument, but I wonder if you think list-articles i've been working on recently are good or bad.  These are about fraternal organization buildings (List of Odd Fellows buildings and others linked in its See also section), and also List of YMCA buildings and List of YWCA buildings.  I think they serve a good purpose, broadly, like the NRHP-listed bridge lists do, and I have chosen to develop them and to open stub articles for all their entries up front.  I think this rapid development approach has headed off a lot of misunderstandings that woulda been generated if they were shorter lists or had many redlinks.  I think i've had a lot more cumulative experience now, good and bad, with dealing with disambiguation- or Masonic- or Connecticut- or other-focused editor groups, and I think that rapidly generating the articles works a lot better, often, than leaving open red-links.  It certainly helps in establishing good categories right away, and also I've seen/learned the need for the architectural categories that correspond to these kinds of buildings.  Doing all of a certain type, at once, seems beneficial.  You can comment or not, but I just thought you might be less miffed about my going ahead with a lot of article generation, if you considered the pretty-good, immediately stable list-articles of these sort that I've been making.

Because it is not falsifiable it seemingly violates Popper's criteria for a good scientific theory. The reason it has so many adherents is because it offers numerous advantages over the Copenhagen Interpretation, among which are the following:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Quantum mechanics becomes a deterministic theory making it more compatible with the theory of relativity and all other physics theory to date which are all deterministic. The Copenhagen Interpretation introduced indeterminacy and randomness into science. Aside from the Copenhagen Interpretation of Quantum Mechanics there is no scientific theory that includes indeterminacy or randomness. Einstein particularly objected to this aspect of the Copenhagen Interpretation. In response to it, he said, \"\"God does not play dice with the universe.\"\"\n",

      "2. It eliminates the \"\"measurement problem.\"\"\n",
      "\n",
      "3. It eliminates Von Neumann's \"\"boundary problem\"\": where to draw the line between the micro world where quantum mechanics applies, and the macro world where it does not. Shortly before his death in 1953, Albert Einstein wrote: \"\"Like the moon has a definite position whether or not we look at the moon, the same must also hold for the atomic objects, as there is no sharp distinction possible between these and macroscopic objects.\"\"\n",
      "\n",
      "4. It eliminates the special place for an observer and human consciousness.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. It restores objective reality of the universe between measurements. Shortly before his death, Albert Einstein also wrote: \"\"Observation cannot CREATE an element of reality like a position, there must be something contained in the complete description of physical reality which corresponds to the possibility of observing a position, already before the observation has been actually made.\"\"\n",
      "\n",
      "6. The wave-particle duality paradox evaporates. It simply and naturally explains the double-slit experiment.

      "  Common sense award I think what is on the causes of autism page is well done.  I also like your common sense approach.  I am not really sure how to send you a message on content but thought I would try this.  I see the vitamin D deficiency hypothesis which should be there because it is in the literature, but the hypothesis does not make any sense because oral supplementation of vitmain D among the very young has increased dramatically over the last 20 years and autism increases with it.  An alternative cause of the epidemic is the opposite: too much vitamin D supplementation and fortification among the very young, which makes a lot of sense considering the calcium channel nature of many autism syndromes, the biochemistry of those with autism, and the epidemic.  I have a book about it on amazon and some academics have told me the ideas in it are provacative.  Does something need significant media exposure before it can appear in wikipedia?  As you seem to know a lot about autism causes would you have any interest in reviewing it?  I could send you a .pdf copy.   \n",

I appreciate your kind words, but causes of autism in fact, most of our autism articles was mostly written by now-departed ; it would need to be a high-quality journal because autism is a featured article, and it would need to be an independent secondary review per our medical sourcing guidelines.

Let's be real: Israel is the occupying force here and has far, far greater military might (not to speak of economic power). The Palestinians are virtually mendicants. Hence it is ludicrous to quote Faisal Husseini calling for \"\"the liberation of all Palestine from the river to the sea\"\" without placing it within the governing geopolitical reality: Israel is armed to the teeth, backed by the even more powerful USA, and has between 200 and 400 nuclear warheads. \n",

      "Hi.  I was amused to see this added to the infobox on The Small Rain, published in 1945. Having collected L'Engle novels for over 30 years, I've still never even SEEN the original cover of this book - and if I did, I'd have to think long and hard before spending several hundred dollars to buy it and scan it for Wikipedia. Rest assured that I will always post first edition covers if I have them, but it's not always possible. For example, my hardback of The Young Unicorns is an ex-library rebinding.  I've searched online for the cover of the first edition, and nobody has one posted.  All I see is lots and lots of copies of the current paperback cover art. No big deal at this end - I know you're just adding standardised info on what we want to post whenever possible. Still, I'll be very surprised if we ever get 100% compliance on L'Engle books of the 1940s to 1960s. Regards, and keep up the good work!  | Talk | contribs \"\n",

      "Re: Talk:Antisemitism, I think you should know why these questions are inappropriate.  1.  Politics and personal views aren't supposed to be a part of this.  2.  There's no right answer.  What do I say, \"\"No, I'm very familiar with arguments about antisemitism\"\"?  Or do I say \"\"No, I really don't know anything about antisemitism.\"\"  Either answer simply give you more ammunition, to which I can't respond, since we're both only anonymous users on the internet.  Do I tell you, \"\"Actually, Norman Finkelstein is my brother, and I don't like the way people attack him.\"\"  Or \"\"My uncle is a Palestinian refugee, that's why I don't like Israel, not because I'm antisemitic.\"\"  Or \"\"Actually I have 12 degrees from Harvard in Middle Eastern Studies.\"\"  If I said that, would you leave me alone?  Of course not: there's no right answer.  That's why we're supposed to deal with the articles, not the users.  3.  Every time you ask me this, you're telling the group that you, SlimVirgin, admin and longtime user, believe that I, Mackan79, am here for illegitimate reasons.  If I respond by saying I've already explained this to you several times, the idea is only rubbed in further.  This is not fair.  It dissuades other people from having a dialogue with me, because they see that you don't want them to. \n",

That's what you're doing with me, for no reason other than that I've shown an interest in articles related to Israel and Judaism.  My edits have not been POV.  My comments have not been POV.  I do consider your questions to be personal attacks, however.  I'd appreciate if you had further questions about my interests that you ask me on my talk page, which would show that you're actually interested, not interjecting them into content disputes.

Stopping at 15 miles you don't even make it into Missouri, you barely make it across the Johnson County border with Wyandotte County. I'd be ok with a 15-20 mile statement, but my hang-up is you are still in Kansas Dorothy. Kansas City's Downtown is not 5 miles wide, so a more accurate range is needed. Maybe try 18-21 miles, cuz at 18 you've at least crossed the border. Yes, you can be in Kansas City at 15 miles, but you are not downtown, in fact MNU is only about 8 miles from the south part of Kansas City (take 135st/HWY150), but that is not downtown (and even further from the Kansas City International Airport). And I'm confused to why we will use the image from the institutional website claiming to the be most reliable, but yet third party site milage site is more reliable than the institutional website milage? Would not the institutional website be reliable for both? As far as 19 and 20 go... 19 is an exact measurement, and the word about was to suppose to give some leeway, as to make it an approximate of 20 (a nice even number) miles. But again, look at the maps, 15 miles gets you to about the KU Med Center, 20 miles and you are right at an exit to Union Station or Bartle Hall.

      "In the \"\"related ethnic groups\"\" section you have included Danes, Norwegians, and Swedes, but excluded Welsh. This makes no sense, and it had been agreed by all editors that the Welsh are among the closest ethnic groups to the English, as anyone familiar with those two peoples knows. Your argument appears to be that the Welsh should not be included because they are English - as a result of the 1536 legislation that annexed Wales to the English kingdom. I can only assume that you have no idea what ethnicity actually means, and I suggest you read the article about it. In short, ethnicity has nothing whatsoever to do with legislation, and the mere annexation of Wales to England did not extinguish Welsh ethnic identity. But you don't need to take my word for it, just look at the Welsh people page. And nor, incidentally, is ethnicity dependent on race or genetics. You have accused me of being a racist, but it is you who are the racist by insisting that ethnicity is defined by race. As for Danes and Norwegians, their inclusion is arguable (though not so much the Swedes - very few of them settled in England). The agreed consensus prior to your unilateral intervention was that no Continental ethnic groups would be included, on the grounds that the inhabitants of the British Isles are much, much closer to each other in terms of culture, history, and language than any groups from mainland Europe. Again, this fact is obvious to anyone who knows them. As a Canadian, it is possible that you may have been ignorant of this. If you are not familiar with a subject, it is probably a good idea not to make edits to its page.\n",

You have deliberately suppressed the historical fact that the English became a conquered nation, and inserted irrelevant descriptions of coats of arms. You then suddenly lurch into a (false) description of Neolithic Britain and Gaul, as if this was in any way relevant to the Norman Conquest. You then mention the Roman Empire and one of its short-lived breakaway states, jumping straight to Offa and Charlemagne, desperate to clutch at any sort of straw that will lend support, however flimsy, to your own preconceived notion that no distinction should be made between the English and the French (despite the obvious fact that these two peoples have a very different language, culture, and ethnic identity). Your mention of the consolidation of kingdoms around capitals such as Winchester and Paris is also completely irrelevant, and your suggestion that the English Channel has been the main focus of English cultural development is demonstrably wrong - the North Sea has been just as important, usually more so.\n",
      "\n",
      "Moving further down still, you have inserted a whole new section entitled \"\"Royalty\"\", and it is here that you expose the full extent of your total misunderstanding of (a) what the article is about, and (b) the English people. English identity is not based on coats of arms as symbols. If you want evidence of this, look at the World Cup, being played in Germany as we speak. The English fans, almost to a man, carry the flag of St. George, and only very rarely the Union Jack. They never, ever carry the royal coat of arms in any form. Being Canadian, I suspect that you have received a rather distorted view of the English through Holywood depictions and the like. The vast majority of English people would laugh in the face of the sort of mediavalist aristocratic fantasy that you are espousing. You then go on to claim that all Englishmen are actually descended from royalty! This is patent nonsense, and once again exposes your own royalist fantasies. The medieval French-speaking monarchy deliberately did not interbreed with its English-speaking subjects. Now, I'm not saying that no genetic material from earlier monarchs exists in the modern English population, but that is not the point. Statistically, every single person on earth might be descended from Julius Caesar, or anyone else you care to name who lived long enough ago. Oh, and French is most definitely not a lingua franca used among Englishmen - we don't need one, because we've already got English. Indeed, English people in general have been notoriously bad at learning foreign languages. And all that guff ab\n",

There is a natural delay introduced between the last pulse (or only pulse in the case of the digit \"\"1\"\") being sent and dial reaching its natural position, then an aditional delay before any further can be sent by the user turning the dial clockwise for the next digit.   So the inter-digit pause is comprise of BOTH the last part of the return movement of the dial and the time taken to \"\"wind it up\"\" ready for the next digit.  In fact in many types of P.O. dial mechanism there was also a slight additional pause immediately upon releasing the dial and before the first pulse was sent, due to the design of the mechanism.  In the SxS switches which predominated in the British network, the inter-digit pause had to be long enough to (a) cause the relays in the current stage to recognize that the dialing of the particular digit had finished, and (b) to allow sufficient time for that stage to find a vacant circuit to the next and for that stage to prepare itself ready to receive the next digit.  31.185.230.165  \n",

      "I personally breed horses. And this is where I'll start telling you a story: the Thoroughbred horse started out as a mixed race horse. It was based on Arab stock and was bred only for speed for many generations, regardless of breed, the horse that ran the race the fastest was bred to other fast horses. The Thoroughbred breeding book is now closed, which means you cannot breed a Thoroughbred to any other breed, because, ANY cross you make outside of the gene pool will reduce the speed of the horse. This is called line breeding, please read this article as a basic \"\"learn to breed\"\" guideline: http://www.learntobreed.com/linebreeding.html. Line breeding(inbreeding) is a useful technique as is outcrossing when advantagous to produce quality results, random mixing is like a child finger-painting and does nothing positive.\n",

When you cited the plant hybridization, that's what you were doing citing a hybrid that was designed in a laboratory and there were not human beings or living animals as a result of a genetic mistake.

Some of them, such as the full-height shots of the western service tower and the two towers flanking the main entrance, aren't available anywhere else as far as I know. The porch photos certainly help to illustrate the Vierendeel trusses that support each floor.  This collection of photos will benefit anyone who is studying what is generally considered to be Kahn's breakthrough work.  If you don't mind, I might make minor changes to some of the descriptions.  In particular, you correctly identified the two types of shafts in the photo taken from the garden on the south side, so I would remove the question marks from that description.\n",

      "If you ever get a chance to visit the Olivetti-Underwood Factory building near Harrisburg, that would be great, especially since that article doesn't have any photos at all.

The standard books on Kahn's work usually include a shot of one of its 72 mushroom-shaped (more-or-less) structural units while it was under construction, one of the entire building taken at an angle from an airplane, and one of the old entrance that was apparently at the northeast corner.  The old entrance seems to have been closed, so from the ground on the outside, options today seem to be limited.  \n",
      "\n",
      "It still might be possible, however, to take a photo that gives viewers a feel for the size and shape of one of those 72 mushroom units, which would be very helpful.  When I follow the link in that article to the aerial photo of the building, I see that those units might be most visible and accessible from the west side, so perhaps a meaningful photo could be taken of the mushroom unit in the northwest corner of the building.  You would want to emphasize the west side of that mushroom unit, which has an indentation separating it from the next unit to the south, which should help to visualize its shape.  The north side of that mushroom has a triangular protrusion between it and the next mushroom to the east, which I suspect would obscure its shape.  Frankly, I'm not sure how well this will work from the ground, but it is worth a try.  Depending on the light, it might work better to try a similar photo of the mushroom unit on the northeast side of the building, where I think the old entrance used to be, again de-emphasizing the protruding triangle on the east side if possible.\n",

Overlooking the article, the same amount of emphasis is placed on his music career as it is placed on his personal life. Actually, somewhat less. I get the impression a relative of Nelson's has had a hand in writing this article. Perhaps a progeny who was directly involved in some of the court cases among the Nelsons and Harmons.

Orbison's life was nowhere near as vibrantly sexual as Ricky Nelson's (an impression that is really backed up in this article), so the biographer slipped in shocking tidbits about other artists, for some reason explaining that only parts of Patsy Cline were found after her airplane accident.

See for example this very well documented site . I suppose Carolus was borrowed from Old High German or Old Franconian. That is why I do not accept the very shortened statement *Kar(i)laz > Carolus. I agree totally about Carolus > Charles, with some typical French phonetic shifts.

A third, hand-held on Steadycam, is added as needed. However, this is NOT the 3, 4, or 5 classic cameras on pedestals rolled around a studio floor for a standard multi-camera sitcom shoot. On Grimm, the setups are completely custom for each sequence. However, when shooting all-digital on ARRIs, recording costs nothing, so they can get quick coverage and footage that would task an old-style production's film budget. He says they will sometimes shoot 10 pages a day. Given the quality of the lighting and coverage, this is astonishing to anyone used to the obsolete Hollywood procedures.\n",

      "\n",
      " Maronite Catholics attacked a newly-built, independent Baptist church near Beirut this month, mauling churchgoers preparing to host war refugees from southern Lebanon. \n",
      "\n",
      "The violence flared up after of several weeks of tense public debate between Maronite and Baptist clergy. More than 20 men from Ajaltoun village attacked Christ Bible Baptist Church on August 2, slashing car tires, breaking the church door and windows, stealing computer and sound equipment, beating men and groping several women. \n",
      "\n",
      "Compass Direct, Aug 22, 2006 \n",
      "\n",
      "A group of 10 Maronite men assaulted Baptist Pastor Raymond Abou-Mekhael and another church member at 6:30 p.m. as they were on their way to retrieve items from their parked cars. The Maronites broke the unidentified church member’s rib and both men’s glasses, smashed the car windows and then dumped the two men inside before joining another group of 10 in attacking the church building. \n",
      "\n",
      "“Police were at the church watching everything,” Abou-Mekhael, 35, told Compass. “They even advised the attackers on what to steal and vandalize.” \n",
      "\n",
      "Abou-Mekhael said that the men were led by Ajaltoun Mayor Khalil Tabet, who had the church officially sealed off with “red wax” immediately after the attack so that no one could enter the building. \n",
      "\n",
      "In an August 6 newspaper article entitled, “No Justification for Building a Baptist Church in a Region whose Overwhelming Majority is Maronite,” the local Maronite bishop attacked the Baptist church’s right to exist. \n",
      "\n",
      "Bishop Guy-Paul Noujaim wrote in local newspapers that there were “no followers of the Baptists in Ajaltoun,” and the “decrees of the Middle East Council of Churches [to which the church does not belong] prohibit building a church in areas without followers therein.” \n",
      "\n",
      "In an e-mail to Compass, Bishop Noujaim said that the Baptist congregation had requested a permit to build a residence but had instead built a church. He declined to answer questions about whether he had been aware of plans to attack the church on August 2, but said that he had been celebrating mass at a church in the mountains when he received a telephone call alerting him to the violence. \n",
      "\n",
      "In articles published in Addiyar and Annahar newspapers, the bishop called for the attorney general to close down the building. \n",
      "\n",
      "“This is nonsense,” said Salim Sahyouni, President of the High Council of Evangelical Churches in Syria and Lebanon, to which the Ajaltoun Baptist church belongs. “We can worship in a legal church building, we can worship in an apartment and we can worship in the free air.” \n",
      "\n",
      "As a Protestant community in Lebanon, “we have the full rights to build churches to worship freely in any place we choose,” Sahyouni told Compass. “We do not need to get permission.” \n",
      "\n",
      "Worship Rights \n",
      "\n",
      "In his written responses to Compass, Bishop Noujaim did not specify why it was illegal to hold church services in a home but claimed that the Baptists were violating the law by owning a printing press in the basement of their building. \n",
      "\n",

I have a soft spot for under appreciated thing that are interesting so wanted to improve the article. I've done what I could with my awful Danish to English skills and was in need of help. I think the page is 75% done and just needs a wee bit more love. If you'd like to help I could set up a sandbox for it so we can work on improving the article. When that's done we'd need to get some sources as it only has one right now. Then we'd need to get the information into English. Once it's in English I can do most of the editing. I'd also like to find someone who'd be able to get some photos. Maybe since it's a museum they'd probably even help if we emailed them. So what do you say, are you in ? (  )\n",

The reliable sourcing and facts will have to be reviewed at that time (or at any time, as new information emerges) and consensus worked out here on the talk page to the community's satisfaction.  I doubt the criminal trial proceedings will resolve that... sure, a conviction or acquittal will result one way or another for the two defendants at issue, but it's an entirely different question as to whether or not evidence emerges at trial conclusively demonstrating that the Iranian Government orchestrated the plot and directed it.  Reliable sourcing and the prevailing views should weigh more than what we as Wikipedia editors think in our own personal opinions.  In time, we shall see what facts are presented, and the argument can be revisited and reviewed in it's entirety.  So let's just resolve the issue of the article title for now, shall we?

This means expanding what we already have, not moving it to another article and adding more copypaste from other articles.  Writing means, doing the research, reading the books and scholarly papers, and doing the hard work.  It does not mean taking what we already have and duplicating it over and over again.

Use of '&' in a sentence is not usually preferred under the WP:MOS, additionally some of the wording might be tightened, e.g. '855th Guard squadron...would occupy'.

      "I think the answers to these questions are unfortunately a bit muddled.  Initially I was going to say that the Public Relations Officers who wrote those articles may have inserted the term without thinking (or knowing).  However one possibility is that since ISAF is a reaction to the Bonn Agreement, it may be considered peacekeeping with the parties including the fledgling national government and the various quasi-legitimate warlords.  But the Taliban and Al-Qaeda are not parties to any agreement.  To my understanding, without an agreement in place between sides, there is no peacekeeping.  \"\"Security Assistance\"\" (the SA in ISAF) to me is a subset of the military term \"\"peace support operations\"\" (peacekeeping is another subset of peace support operations).  In the end, I think the NATO and ISAF webpages must be authoritative, and I have seen no mention of the term \"\"peacekeeping\"\" on any of the main documents I have looked at.  I don't claim to be an authority, and soldiers (and bureaucrats, and politicians) argue about the meaning of words all the time, but to me 'peacekeeping' has a specific meaning that ISAF does not fit.   \"\n",

      "\n",
      "Candid Camera had its roots in Six Photographers, a groundbreaking exhibition held in Sydney in May 1955, which concentrated on what was still a relatively new development in Australian photography and featured the work of Max Dupain, David Potts, Axel Poignant, Gordon Andrews, Kerry Dundas and Hal Missingham.Robinson, Julie \"\"Candid Camera: Australian Photography 1950s–1970s\"\" Art Gallery of South Australia exhibition catalogMcDonald, Patrick \"\"The Way We Were\"\" The Advertiser, 20 May 2010 AdelaideNow websiteNewton, Gael \"\"Shades Of Light: Photography And Australia 1839-1988\"\" Collins Australia, 1988 (ISBN 0732224055) The work of the first three of these artists is also represented in Candid Camera. Six Photographers, an artist-initiated show that featured 200 images at a time when exhibitions of personal photographic work were rare, was regarded as sufficiently influential for the Art Gallery of New South Wales to commemorate it with a show of the same name featuring the same six photographers, more than 50 years after it had first been presented.Newton, Gael \"\"Shades Of Light: Photography And Australia 1839-1988\"\" Collins Australia, 1988 (ISBN 0732224055)Newton, Gael \"\"Silver And Grey: Fifty Years Of Australian Photography 1900-1950\"\" Angus & Robertson, 1980 (ISBN 0207141096)Art Gallery of New South Wales Exhibitions Archive AGNSW websiteAllen, Christopher \"\"Decisive Moments\"\", The Australian, 27 February 2010 The Australian website This second version of Six Photographers featured 29 images, many of them shown in 1955, and concentrated on works from the same period (the late forties through to the mid-fifties).\n",
      "\n",
      "Candid Camera, while about half the size of the 1955 Sydney exhibition, covered a significantly wider range of artists and looks not just at the foundations of Australian social documentary photography but at the era that curator Julie Robinson clearly regards as its golden age – the fifties, sixties and seventies.\n",
      "\n",
      "In line with the statements issued by the six photographers group, Candid Camera featured “images which appear unposed, spontaneous, or with their subjects captured unaware”. Though the majority of the photos in the exhibition (more than 80 in total) were taken in Australia, images by Australian photographers working overseas were also included.Allen, Christopher \"\"Unguarded Moments\"\", The Australian, 17 July 2010 The Australian websiteEmmett, Patrick \"\"Candid Camera\"\" ABC Television interview, originally broadcast on Stateline, 28 May 2010 ABC website Subjects included youth subcultures, newly arrived migrants, nuns, a number of prime ministers (though not all were in office at the time of the photo), musicians such as Bon Scott of AC/DC, and ordinary people in everyday settings: at work, at the beach and at bus stops.\n",
      "\n",
      "Photographers represented in Candid Camera included Max Dupain, David Moore, Jeff Carter, Max Pam, Robert McFarlane, Mervyn Bishop, Rennie Ellis, Carol Jerrems and Roger Scott and a number of others. Of those named, all have work held in the permanent collection of National Gallery Of Australia. Mervyn Bishop is the only Aboriginal Australian to have been included, and though his work has primarily been in New South Wales, Robert McFarlane was the only photographer to be born in South Australia. In this last regard, Candid Camera was very different to Century In Focus, an earlier large-scale photographic survey curated by Robinson, which dealt only with images taken in South Australia.Robinson,\n",

I found nothing relevant for Scompton, but when I redid the search later, I did get results thru a search for Scompton AND Scarborough. I ought not to have deleted the entry based on a Google search turning up nothing.Personally, I generally don't see any value in having a section for nicknames for the municipality.  But there is obviously precedent for having it (e.g. Toronto).  The problem I have with these sections is that they end up including obvious entries (like \"\"Hogtown\"\" for Toronto), but then also up end up including nicknames that may be used in some circles but don't have particularly wide usage.  The particular problem here in the Scarborough article is that so many of the nicknames have such a negative connotation  perhaps that's just a reflection of public perception, but I do believe that it does, to a degree, give the reader the wrong impression of the place.  Frankly, I am just waiting for someone to add \"\"Scandahar\"\" to the list. I'm not from Scarborough, so I will leave the list in the hands of folks who have a better sense of whether its inclusion is justified.

The answer to your first question is no, whites from Liverpool speak Scouse, and they don't speak the same as whites from South London, of course, but I don't see what that has to do with White South African English.  However, the answer to your second question is mostly yes.  Most blacks from Boston do sound pretty much the same as blacks from New Orleans.  Most blacks from both areas speak what's called African American Vernacular English (of you're into political correctness, which you seem to be), which is an ethnolect and a sociolect that is becoming more and more different from the speech of whites in America.  I'm not exactly sure what you mean by \"\"Mother Tongue English speakers\"\".  Do you mean L1 varieties?  \n",

I simply temporarily \"\"took it over\"\", if you will, to make it a better description of White South African English.  Those just happened to be the words I decided to use.  It says at the top of this article that the article was in need of attention by an expert on this subject, and while I am no expert, I certainly seem to be the closest thing to it that this article has ever seen (with the notable exception of JackLumber).  I think you knew what I meant by that expression, but it's certainly possible that you didn't.\n",
      "Finally, I will respond to your earlier comment that \"\"White South African English\"\" as a title for this article is \"\"simply racist\"\".  You really haven't explained to me how that would be a racist title.  I'm going to assume that you meant either: 1.) That title would suggest that only whites in South Africa speak English and absolutely no one else does. 2.) That title would suggest that whites are the most important group in South Africa, they're are better than everyone else, and they are thus the only group in South Africa deserving an article on the type of English they speak.  Both of these choices seem rather absurd to me.  If you thought 1.), then I already proposed a solution for that.  We could give each Indian South African English, Black South African English, and White South African English its own article to show that there are indeed other dialects of English spoken in South Africa besides WSAfE.  If you thought 2.), then you are racist.  Let me explain.  For that title to be racist I would have to be white.  If I were a racist white person I would want that to be the title of the article to show that whites are better and that the way they speak is better.  Since we are both anonymous, however, there is no way you could possibly know my race.  You would have to rely on conjecture.  In this case, your guess was that I was white.  After all, if I were black and I proposed that, I would have to somehow be racist against myself.  What I don't understand for sure is why you assumed I was white.  That's quite a racist assumption.  Anyone in the world can edit Wikipedia; people from all races.  Yet you assumed I was white.  Unless you had statistics to back that assumption up, which you didn't, then that's \"\"simply racist\"\".  Even if you did have statistics to back it up, it still could be racist.  To me, what you're saying is that only white people edit Wikipedia, and that people of other races aren't intelligent enough.  Of course, I don't for sure, but that's my conjecture.   \"\n",

      "I am the author of Qutbi Bohra article. I had written this article just as an informative content for wikipedia and my intentions were to update the information regarding a new sect that was formed. I am a writer and have written many articles in different media. I love to write. I came to know of Wikipedia editing very recently through a friend when he showed me how wikipedia works and editors can make contributions. It was a time when i had heard of Qutbi Bohra and when i searched the internet i got evidence regarding the same in 3 newspapers mentioning it and a newsletter. This satisfied the noteablity ans verifyablity condition of the article. I gathered information regarding the sect from the community members whom i know and have recorded my discussion with them, with their permission. Further more i also got information regarding some past acts of Khuzaima Qutbuddin which were defamatory in nature but would prove the formation of the sect. But i did not use it as per the rules of wikipedia. I have written the entire article from third person point of view, as usually written for publications and have provided supportive evidence in most of the cases and due to frequent coercing by Ftutocdg i have also written a complete article,'succession issue' to explain the actual situation which Ftutocdg is trying to hide in his bid to get the Qutbi Bohra article removed. The reason that he is giving is just his point of view that he is trying to impose on the article. He has regularly done vandalism to this article and also has done the same to many Dawoodi Bohra articles along with some other editors in his group. As mentioned by Ftutocdg you can check the contribution i have made to Wikipedia, i have done all my edits with thorough study and reliable references. I would also like to suggest you to please look into the contribution of Ftutocdg and his group of editors they have just created a lot of chaos using the dark side of the very principles of Wikipedia the helps develop an article. I am sorry to say but i have spend more time giving explaination to Ftutocdg than write or edit an article. Whenever i login i first check whether he has vandalised the article or not. I have applied for protection in comments while reverting but i dont know the actual procedure involved. As regards your taggings i am very new to Wikipedia and i will require the help of experienced and well established administrators like you to guide me in my efforts. I request you if you can be more specific as to you tagging of the article in my talk page or article talk page so that i can take it up to the standards of Wikipedia. And also use the same principles when creating or editing other articles. Thank you again for all your efforts and time.\n",

      "The J.D. is not a doctoral level degree. That someone chooses to call it that means nothing. There is at least one college that calls all of it B.S.-level alumnae \"\"doctor\"\" because of some tradition, akin to the Italian use of Dottore. Everyone agreed that the old D.Pharm., before the recent changes, was a master's-level degree. When I see surveys of \"\"highest level of education completed\"\" I often see the J.D. lumped with professional master's degrees like a M.Arch. (usually 2-3 years) or M.S.W. or the like. The D.C. was often lumped in there, but they're made an effort to get more people to have completed a B.S. first to raise their standing, as pharmacy is trying to do. As mentioned, in many fields the terminal degree is a master's, for example in many artistic fields (M.F.A.). I clearly recall arguments, reported in The Chronicle of Higher Ed., over whether a J.D. holder should be a university's president given the lack of a terminal/doctoral degree. I also point out that following a J.D. one still takes a master's or (higher) doctorate as the next step, if desired. In my experience, J.D. holders occasionally use \"\"Doctor\"\" in very formal settings in academiaif speaking at a graduation ceremonybut for the most part, no. Certainly, I consider them to have a degree that is the equivalent of a 3-year M.Arch. Since there is no pre-law curriculum, it just isn't comparable  to a Ph.D. biologist who took a B.S. and M.S. in the same subject.  \"\n",

Bryant (p. 860, right column) merely speculates that whaling may have been the cause of its disappearance, stating that \"\"This population of gray whales apparently disappeared during periods of active coastal whaling on both sides of the North Atlantic, supporting the possibility [my italics] that whaling activities were responsible for, or at least contributed to, its extinction\"\". However, these whaling activities (as far as we know) primarily targeted right whales, as I stated above. Earlier (p. 860, left column) he asks \"\"Could the eastern North Atlantic gray whale have been extirpated by whaling activities? Unfortunately, early whaling activities off the coast of Europe are poorly documented.\"\" This alone is enough to remove your inaccurate assumption, but I'll watch as you scramble for countless secondary sources blindly repeating the same thing again and again.

For example, your recent edit to Bentley College inserted someone who does not appear to meet the criteria in Wikipedia:Notability and has been removed. Don't be discouraged; you're more than welcome to contribute, and seem to have plenty of good contributions.

      "\n",
      "\"\"Baldwin was careful to emphasise that the Treaties were the substance of his objections. Standfordham wrote to the King, on 7 October, 'I saw Mr Baldwin who, in reply to my question \"\"Do you want to turn the Government out?\"\" said \"\"Yes, but not on the Campbell issue, but on the Russian Treaties which the country generally condemns.\"\" He sees no alternative to a dissolution; it has always been expected, some wished for it before now, though he is opposed to hastening the Government's fall. ...' ... And it is true that only in the House of Commons were Baldwin's strictures based on the Campbell case – at Newcastle on 2 October he congratulated MacDonald on the agreement, achieved at a conference in London, on the Dawes Plan for reparations, and then spent the rest of the speech alternately pouring scorn on the Labour party's subservience to its extremists, and tearing to pieces the Russian agreement. But the final debate on 8 October was a mean Parliamentary occasion. Two days before, in a meeting which was something of a suave qui puet, the Cabinet decided to take it as a vote of confidence, preferring to go out on the Campbell case to a defeat on the Russian Treaties which might give the left wing too much prominence.—Middlemas and Barnes, p. 273.  \"\n",

If they labeled liberal groups as \"\"hate groups\"\" too, then maybe they might be considered balanced.  As it is, it's just one-sided, and it's just not encyclopedic for that reason, among others.

I have had benefit of learning through many patient and kind admins/co-editors who leave me detailed actionable feedbakc to improve my edits, i usually incorporate their feedback and remove from my page (i use my page as to do list) but hard to tolerate the destructive and unethical bullies like Sityush and some more getting warning form others abt it..it makes me feel its is gang of TALIBANS...i hope not... please help me deal with it, help me educate and guide admins to become more constructive, pragmatic, flexible and they still maintain quality without being butchers or being arrogant)\"\n",

This points the finger at Phelps' being in the Prague safe house prior to his purportedly first meeting with the team to discuss the mission and where he incidentally mentions his stay at the Drake.

      " OK, I'll grant to both of you that, in a perfect world, the interest factor is as important as everything else I've outlined ... but we are so far from a perfect world at DYK and there is so much that needs attention !  DYK has the opportunity to train editors early on and get articles off on the right foot ... instead, procedures and practices (there and at WIKICUP) encourage the churning out of deficient articles to gain perceived prizes.  And what happens to the \"\"interest factor\"\" is the same as what happens to prose and sourcing ... editors learn, indeed are encouraged by reviewers, to pad up their articles so that expansion/length is met, and there is often no regard for whether that padding is a) based on reliable sources, b) relevant to the article, or c) well written.  A similar thing happens when we demand interesting hooks ... that quickly becomes scandalously ridiculous tabloid style hooks, often with BLP issues or MEDRS issues of plain faulty hooks because non-reliable sources are used.  We have admins whose own DYK hooks are inaccurate, and are passed, based on blog sources. Recently. SO ... yes, interesting hooks might be one part of training new and experienced editors and encouraging responsible and policy-compliant editing, but there's a huge iceberg under that tip at DYK that is not being addressed because the few qualified reviewers who are active there cannot keep up with the volume, and we have several entrenched DYK regulars who either don't care about copyvio and reliable sources or simply and still after many years of editing do not even understand core policies.  There is a need to address the whole picture not just \"\"lame hooks\"\" and the whole picture cannot be corrected unless you work with the few clueful regulars there to deal with the several who lack clue, impose their will, and routinely place deficient articles on the mainpage.   DYK will never be eliminated (it probably should be because it is responsible for so much truly bad content that will never be cleaned up), so can we at least work to improve reviewing there ?  A slowdown in volume would help, along with an elimination of QPQ so that knowledgeable reviewers can assure our mainpage is being used responsibly.  But part of that is dealing with the experienced \"\"leaders\"\" at DYK who don't know and won't enforce policy and good editing practice ... work with the few who do.  (Talk) \"\n",

Sometimes the helpee will say \"\"I really have to look at the numbers to see who is who.\"\" On the contrary, I see few Guest### nicks, and while they are confusing, they are definitely not as widespread as the instances of WPhelp. These users came from the template  which does not supply a nick parameter.\n",

      "...the Nixon administration decided to try to ensure that international financial relations should be taken out of the control of state Central Banks and should be increasingly centred upon private financial operators. It sought to achieve this goal through exploiting US control over  international oil supplies. \n",
      "\n",
      "It is still widely believed that the sharp and steep increase in oil prices  in 1973 was carried out by the Gulf states as part of an anti-Israel and anti-US policy connected to the Yom Kippur war.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Yet as we now know, the oil price rises were the result of US influence on the oil states and they were arranged in part as an exercise in economic statecraft directed against America’s ‘allies’ in Western Europe and Japan. And another dimension of the Nixon administration’s policy on oil price rises was to give a new role, through them, to the US private banks in international financial relations.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Nixon administration was planning to get OPEC to greatly increase its oil prices a full two years before OPEC did so and as early as 1972 the Nixon administration planned for the US private banks to recycle the petrodollars when OPEC finally did take US advice and jack up oil prices.  \n",
      "\n",
      "The Nixon administration understood the way in which the US state could use  expanding private financial markets as a political multiplier of the impact of US Treasury moves with the dollar. But according to the Nixon’s Ambassador in Saudi Arabia at the time, the principal political objective behind Nixon’s drive for the OPEC oil price rise was to deal a crippling blow to the Japanese and European economies, both overwhelmingly dependent on Middle East Oil, rather than to decisively transform international financial affairs. \n",
      "\n",
      "Nevertheless , Nixon’s officials  showed far more strategic insight into the consequences of what they were attempting than most political scientists would credit any government with. Its capacity for deception both over the oil price rise and in the way in which it manipulated discussions with its ‘allies’ in the IMF over so-called ‘international monetary reform’ was brilliant.\n",
      "\n",
      "The US government realised that the oil price rises would produce an enormous increase in the dollar earnings of oil states that could not absorb such funds into their own productive sectors.\n",
      "\n",
      "At the same time, the oil price rises would plunge very many states into serious trade deficits as the costs of their oil imports soared. So the so-called petrodollars would have to be recycled from the Gulf through the Western banking systems to non-oil-producing states.\n",
      "\n",
      "Other governments had wanted the petrodollars to be recycled through the  IMF.  But the US rejected this, insisting  the Atlantic world’s private banks (at that time led by American banks) should be the recycling vehicles.

      "Find any other equivalent. You guys have changed the entire subject. The fact of the matter is that you can not call ethnic groups prior to 1919 as Azerbaijani; there was no such defined identity. Why are there articles on the Dutchy? The Dutchy were more defined as a group than were the Turkic peoples living in those lands… why not plain German? And again, Parishan is using Russian and Soviet propaganda material, which maintained such a position, including for the Turks living in Armenia, to stop Turkey's expansionism… they had Turks in Nakhichevan and those in Armenia rather to adhere to an Azerbaijani identity than Turkish. But prior to the Soviet rules, those people were not identifying themselves, neither were they identified as such. I am wondering how much more can Parishan provide other than Soviet-Russian historiography which was known to be tainted when covering ethnic groups and ethno genesis, turning ethnic groups into groups that all originated from the identities forming the Union, some sort of Self-Sufficient system. This process already started during the end of the Russian Empire, Roy writes: In Azerbaijan for a brief period (the governorate of Vorontsov in the 1850s, and that of Goltsyn from 1896 to 1905), the Russians encouraged the development of an Azeri identity in order to weaken links with Iran and Turkey (The New Central Asia The Creation of Nations by Olivier Roy I.B.Tauris, (2000) p.56)\n",
      "\n",
      "During the process, many different groups were pushed into being identified as ethnically Azerbaijani, including Kurds, who haven't until recently when groups wanted their independence requested their identity to be changed: In 1988 some 10,000 Kurds in Azerbaijan returned their Azeri identity papers to Moscow with the explicit request that their identity be changed from Azeri to Kurd. (A Modern History of the Kurds by David McDowall, I.B.Tauris (2004), p.493)\n",
      "\n",
      "And to use Parishan’s opening, it is funny how Parishan is requesting sources for those quotes, Ulvi were you not a participant on the arbitration enforcement? How many sources were used? Parishan has probably missed references like this: In 1897 'Tatars'-which officially included most Muslim groups... (Socialism in Georgian Colors: The European Road to Social Democracy, 1883-1917, Harvard University Press (2005) p. 19)\n",
      "\n",
      "Here, another quote missed by Parishan: In Contrast with the Armenians, the Azerbaijani national identity is very recent. In fact, the very name \"\"Azerbaijani\"\" was not widely used until the 1930s; before that, Azerbaijani intellectuals were unsure whether they should call themselves Caucasian Turks, Muslims, Tatars or something else.

The two seasons are not directly chronological in nature, therefore there is no issue with differentiation. Following some sort of makeshift standard is desirable when it comes to the colour schemes on television seasons because it keeps petty arguments and debates from arising, similar to the ones above. I am all for following the unspoken standard; changing these schemes to match their marketing material. Please, let me know what you think. Cheers,\n",

      "Negative capability is more fully articulated as a social theory by Roberto Unger in his work on false necessity. It differs slightly from Keats in that he uses it to describe the individual's challenge to an existing social order and the capacity to collapse the distance between a context-preserving routine and a context-transforming challenge. In this way it is less about uncertainty and more about a state of empowering resistance, albeit not necessarily within a stable institutional space. \n",

In this manner, relegating Keats to background section of the entry might not work (nor would it really do justice to the legacy of poetry and English litalthough this part of the entry needs to be developed more). So, any suggestions/ideas on how to integrate? Or should we create two separate entries, e.g. \"\"Negative capacity (poetry)\"\" and \"\"Negative capacity (philosophy/social theory)\"\"?   \"\n",

      "\":::::LOL, I just have to reply to Danny Muse's reply to Elenap. It's not nice, but I have to speak. When will you get it Danny? Propaganda and logical fallacies are not a reasonable method of influencing people, especially if you are claiming to represent God and be a Christian, so why do you continue with them and your specious reasoning? All the points in your reply can easily be refuted. You said above: \"\"If text in one place is inappropriate or excessive . . .\"\" You have totally failed to prove the premise of your argument, but you then presumptuously assume that everyone will just blindly accept your wanted opinions as facts, and so you come out with a straw man argument about \"\"inappropriate and excessive\"\". You get the medal for surreptitious false reasoning. You then go on with another blatantly false statement: \"\"And as far as this section being POV, its title, \"\"Books Critical of the Group\"\" proves that it is by definition a POV section.\"\" Danny, how exactly is something that is 'critical' proof that it is biased or POV? You have failed totally to make even the most basic case for your assumed conclusions; you just jump there with one giant false leap. Criticism is not by default proof of a bias, POV, or non-objectivity as you incorrectly assume. For example, if you said \"\"five plus five is thirteen\"\", someone could objectively and neutrally criticise your ability at maths, and your conclusion, and prove you wrong, without having any biased point of view, or dubious agenda. Facts can be proven false or true, that is the rational basis of objective reasoning. Merely being critical is not a valid cause for rejection of the one criticising, as you manipulatively try and twist into its meaning with more ad hominem. You also ignore the hypocrisy of your argument, as Jehovah's Witnesses have masses of material heavily criticising other religions, so by your default, it should all be rejected as POV, biased, and highly subjective, and of little of no value. You have shot yourself in the foot Danny. You then go on with paragraphs of irrelevant red herrings, straw men, and more ad hominem character assassinations, in true Watch Tower fashion. You should read these Watch Tower articles on criticism and open-mindedness. \n",

Paint, cages and other cover-ups can not remove the actual history. Sure there have been previous wars over the content. I have been involved for over thirteen years getting the documents, interviews and real history of the tragedy, while trying to correct the media's versions, which are full of errors and out right misinformation. If some of the articles on the net and in the history of the media were used, Houston McCoy would be \"\"George McCoy\"\", Whitman would be the Devil or evil (read Gary Lavergne's \"\"Why Did He Do IT\"\" on his website (this is the author of \"\"A Sniper In The Tower\"\", who claimed the tower tragedy was the \"\"Worst Mass Murder In American History\"\", which I fought and proved that Andrew Kehoe was the worst until Whitman). Also, in Lavergne's article, he claims Whitman would be alive as of August 1, 2006, if the Supreme Court had not banned the death penalty a few years after the tragedy, even though Whitman had a Glioblastoma Grade IV brain tumor that would have killed him within a year - even if he had not gone up in the tower. All Jimbo Wales has ever done is react to the protests and misguided rule benders like BZUK and Gavia immer, who know nothing about the tragedy or the rules of a valid contribution. They (Gavia and BZUK), are just like Wales, memes who have no knowledge of what they are doing, just applying their own personal bias' for what they blindly consider acts of vandalism, with no proof, and not even looking at the contribution and it's sourcing.

The major problem I see in doing this is that using only secondary sources, which I assume is desired, will result in an attackee timeline, for events during the attack, that's composed largely of McGonagle's recall of the attack (i.e., COI findings about events during the attack, and their sequence, are almost exclusively based on McGonagle's testimony; and the NSA History Report used the COI findings as a reference source).  So, for the attackee, the timeline may represent the \"\"official view,\"\" as reported in NSA's History Report; but its base information source, McGonagle testimony, can be easily shown as being fraught with errors.  Nonetheless, as long it's made clear to readers that the timeline is based on secondary sources, and that there is contention about the reliably of the secondary sources' references, then I suppose it would be a fair representation of the matter.\n",

The lack of a more thorough investigation into whether Judge Ware told the same fabrication in his personal statement to law school is a CRITICAL ITEM that should be part of the commentary, as it is more likely than not that he did tell the same fabricated story, which would make his law degree fraudulent subjecting him to immediate disbarment.

      "There are plenty of sources which are not age old and I have provided them before considering I used to take part in actual discussion on discussion pages until DIREKTOR would then find a way to limit that discussion in that the discussion page is 'not a forum'. He is against any academic progress and democracy in general. Stating such is; of course, an attack on his character even though he openly worships communist totalitarian regimes here on wikipedia and communist totalitarian dictatorships and dictators. Even when there is vast consensus against him, since he is paid to be here, he knows every possible way to limit such exposure and simply logs complaints against the opposition until they are completely outlawed and banned. Typically this type of behavior is traditional in communist totalitarian dictatorships. My comment was of course a legitimate content comment as all content is monitored and approved by DIREKTOR and his lobby group here on wikipedia. Unless you have something negative to add - don't add it at all because he will have it removed. This is because this topic in itself is still political in modern day Croatia where any type of objective historical discussion is branded as communist revisionism as outlined by one Dr. Ante Birin at the Croatian Historic Institute who recently held a great discussion on the matter. I would like to point out that the user DIREKTOR has directly linked me to 'nazism' - even though anyone with half a brain knows that German National Socialism is not the same as Croatian Ustasism - but of course, that is not an attack on my personal character. I have not been blocked for any relevant reason other than the fact that I oppose DIREKTORs nonacademic claim to all WW2 Croatia-related articles. Some of my statements were in hope that someone would notice his bias which is the biggest elephant I have ever seen standing in a room ever. Regarding Dr. Pavelic's nationality - Pavelic did not believe in Yugoslavism, he was a self-declared anti-yugoslav and on many occasions publicly -and in written form - argued the idiotic basis of such a movement. But of course it only makes sense to have Pavelic be a Yugoslav so that tito can be considered a Croat in DIREKTORs logical political platform here on wikipedia. Thank you.\n",

If one of the reasons for AM404 being an analgetic was TRPV1 activation, it would have to be the opposite to that of capsaicine. The only wat in which TRPV1 agonism would decrease pain is that a prolonged exposure to high doses of the agonist decreases the sensitivity, which is the case in any type of receptor activation, but this would mean that AM404 is no more an analgetic than capsaicine or any other source of pain... and the relief would come after a period of pain actually getting worse.\n",

Or are you just going to keep making up ridiculous standards like \"\"you can hear it\"\"? There are policies. I am applying and following them. You're refusing to. It's that simple.   \"\n",

The edits made by multiple IP addresses on this page, as you know,  have been (not always but  by and large) at best unhelpful but much more often downright offensive and I see absolutely no reason why that should be allowed to continue.  Again, you know I am not talking about the juvenile HI MOMs - they are also annoying, but that is not what plagues this page.  We are plagued by targeted vandalism - changing \"\"Obama\"\" to \"\"Osama\"\", for example, and the regular changing of text that has hidden text clearly requesting that it not be changed right there, plus blatant POV pushing, trolling, etc.  Classic case for permanent sprot. The result, when sprot is in place, is the ability to conscientiously edit and improve the article (which has a changing base of facts so needs constant attention).  But rather than being able to easily evaluate substantive changes that responsible editors make, we are bogged down in having to go through screen after screen of pure and often vicious vandalism. For what positive reason, may I ask?\n",

Two-three weeks is much better than what we had a few weeks ago, and may coincide with any announcement that Senator Obama makes which is also good timing for sprot, but  I'd like to understand why you would want it not to be an extended one, because I can't make any sense out of your position on this, as a person (you, I mean) who clearly is interested in having this remain a high quality page, as evidenced by the excellent work you do here, and the fact that this page has been by far your main area of Wikipedia editing.    | talk \n",

      "Hi Mary. I'm not going to bother adding anything to the Trance page, as that fellow Roux and his minions monitor what I say, to silence it before the public gets to read it. I suspect this has to do with the somewhat decline in Trance popularity starting in 2008. Last year I would go on this page to write about the trends of Trance, and they experienced a backlash, as their chosen leader (Armin) had not lost the polls yet. They couldn't believe that the trends could possibly be changing for the next generation in the dance scene. They experienced personal feelings of hatred towards me, thinking I was a House only propagator. In reality I am actually a Trance DJ, but don't tell them this, as it makes the whole situation even more fun for me. That said, there is no point in me adding stuff to the page because it will be deleted. I am currently writing a very complicated article on dance music if you want to proof read it, find a way to provide me with an e-mail address if you want.\n",
      "\n",
      "The history of Trance is very complicated. For one thing, to put it simply, Trance isn't really a genre of music. (I hate to put it this bluntly and it kind of sounds crazy). This is why you can't find information. The Snoman section on Trance in his published book is mostly false hopes. When people do write about it, it is often from the perspective of industry interests who have equity stakes in the genre, so they often 'invent information' in attempts to keep the label in the media. Most of these clever music terms are the inventions of the English ) Sneaky buggers.\n",
      "\n",
      "As Armin puts it, it is more 'A state of trance' like his show is titled. This observation is correct. It doesn't matter what its called, as long as its good. What he means when he says Trance is a state of mind, is that it is not some formulaic equation that determines what is and what isn't. All of these labels are just styles and buzz-words. You will find difficulty locating written information on Trance because it is just another offshoot of House, one of the many. The articles that you will find are probably from punters who came out of the Tiesto generation. Tiesto is in fact a House DJ, but don't tell punters this, or they may commit suicide. Many have currently experienced heart attacks or early menopause, when they found out Tiesto went back to a House sound now. Good Luck.\n",

I didn't said anything about me to block him, because I don't have this kind of power. Starting three or four weeks ago, an anonymous user, kept editing on Vaslui page, false information about the team. The media speculated many transfers, and this user edited them all as being sure transfers. This was for almost three weeks, when I just couldn't keep revert his edits anymore. So I started to reedit every single information from Vaslui page, and linked every sentence (because there was no reference before), and I applied for semi-protection for SC Vaslui page. After I got the page protected, there was no longer any false information, until  edited again one of the players who just signed for Vaslui (back then, he wasn't). I saw his contribs, and noticed that he is 13 years old, and is a big SC Vaslui fan, and he edited almost the exact pages the anonymous editor wrote before. I don't think that's a coincidence. However, I noticed he has no current activity, so I think he either got my message, or he was blocked by admins. Either way, I'm more than happy. Hope you see this message, and reply me.

The first, most important thing, is that, as a general rule, you should not try to write an article about yourself. This is because we have found that people with a conflict of interest simply are unable to write good, well-sourced, neutral articles about themselves or organizations they are closely involved with. As such, once you are notable enough, someone will eventually make an article on you.

There is no explanation in the article about the statistics of temperature records, nor about the need (very important in science) to distinguish random fluctuations from changes caused by an underlying process.

      "Well, I was thinking in terms of those who believe in the avatarship of Hariakhan Baba and his being the same as Lahiri Mahsaya's guru. He was already teaching long before Yogananda was even born, in fact even before Lahiri Mahasaya started his ministry. There are accounts of Panchanon Bhattacarya as well as Tincouri and Ducouri Lahiri handing prayaschitta money directly to Babaji, and also a personal visit of Babaji to the house of Lahiri Mahasaya witnessed by Pranavananda. So it is somewhat safe to conclude that Mahavatar Babaji was a \"\"normal\"\" human being intermingling with people in civilization, though probably exaggerated thru time. So, what we need here is a book published before Autobiography of a Yogi saying that the Baba of Hariakhan is Lahiri Mahasaya's guru? What if I can provide that?

While I have your attention  I had an idea that you might be able to assist with - since your technical chops are undoubtedly better than mine. In short - Is it possible to move the \"\"Dodge City Peace Commission\"\" photo from its current location, blow it up to a larger size, and place that enlarged photo so that it is placed in what is currently a large blank space next to the Table of Contents? I think it would make a far more attractive page. I probably should mention that, prior to turning to writing full-time, I worked for several years as a corporate art director - who specialized in page layouts. Let me know what you think about the idea. Also let me know if there are any remaining issues with the Bassett article that you think should be addressed. I'm sure we can work together.   \"\n",

      "A book by fr. Gino Conti was wiped out for the second time.\n",
      "Another censorship (fr. Pezzi dismissed by Comboni missionaries). Pezzi admitted it in a public interview, whose reference was already in the article. Fr. Pezzi, with Kiko and Carmen, is in the main equipe of the Way; with Kiko and Carmen signs letters to the Pope (cfr. letter of 17 Jan 2006), etc.\n",
      "The Statute is not an approval. The Statute is a temporary (up to June 2007) guideline. The Statute is an incomplete guideline because it often refers to an unpublished Catechetical Directory (cf. Statute articles 11, 19, 28§2, etc).\n",
      "The most famous papal pronouncement about the Way is on a letter to mgr. Cordes on August 1990 (letter addressed to Cordes, not to Kiko), where he says \"\"I acknowledge the Way\"\" but these words are preceded by \"\"having seen the documentation you sent me, welcoming the request address to me\"\".\n",
      "The Statute was given by Pontifical Council for the Laity, not by John Paul II. Also, in the days following publication of the Statute, John Paul II did not mention in his Angelus and speeches. His first mention will come months after. Popes can change their mind about the Way.\n",
      "Popes can change their mind, if the Way doesn't obey to the Pope. Most recent documents show liturgy issues up to end of 2005.\n",
      "There are some serious concerns. Discussions about the Way are about heresies, obedience, liturgy... Only Roman Catholic hierarchy has the right to correct and guide the Way.\n",
      "\"\"Factoid\"\" about st. Pius from Pietrelcina is actually documented by fr. Enrico Zoffoli, in a book and public letters to some Italian Cardinals and Bishops. In the worst case, it's realistic that st. Pius, who was confessor for people from lots of countries (including U.S. people from nearest NATO base), knew something about Kiko movement in Madrid between 1964 and 1967.\n",
      "The temporary Statute was artificially elevated to highest \"\"We're Approved\"\" Neocatechumenal propaganda.\n",
      "Gennarini, the chief of the Way in the U.S., did actually give a \"\"Neocatechumenal spin\"\" interpretation, documented also by Jimmi Akin.\n",
      "Kiko, Carmen and Pezzi were thanking for \"\"granting a period of two years\"\", but Benedict XVI decisions about that \"\"widespread manner\"\" were timed «not exceeding two years». That is: Benedict XVI wants to solve quickly the problem, but Kiko, Carmen and Pezzi do not.\n",
      "\"\"Note: the echoes were never put in place of the homily, or meant to sound like one\"\": this valuable sentence tries to \"\"explain\"\" in Neocatechumenalspeak the \"\"decision of the Holy Father\"\" to require homily only from deacons and priests.\n",
      "On the exchange of peace, permission is granted to the Neocatechumenal Way to continue «giving peace as done in the Early Church» - everyone can verify that the original text of Arinze's letter does not contain such words. Why do Neocatechumenals need a distort and falsified citation? Correct text was: «on the exchange of peace, permission is granted to the Neocatechumenal Way to continue using the indult already granted, pending further instructions» (please note: indult - that is: special permission - and pending further instructions - that is: the indult is temporary).\n",

Forget the Magyarisation terms. and now a little summary of your claim (try to concentrate):  There was full education in language X (like in Slovakia, Romania, Serbia, Croatia) and the government saw that (and this is your claim and is not true, because the same would apply to the neighbouring countires) the minorities start to lose their language. As a result it decided to restrict education in language X (you say to a few subjects, I say de-facto to 2 hours a week - but it does not matter), because there was \"\"no need\"\" to teach some subjects in their language (which is a sociolinguistic non-sense). This is an illogical and actually chauvinist statement. What any normal government should do in such situation (wrongly claimed by you) is AT LEAST not restrict education in the language. Secondly, bilingual schools are no minority schools. Minority schools are only schools were the full language of education is the given language. Therefore the minority schools were literally shut down. This holds by definition and cannot be subject to any exaggeration.    \n",

People can argue forever over whether the transistor is \"\"voltage controlled\"\" or \"\"current controlled.\"\"  And each side means something different by that.  And each side is trying to win an argument, not trying to clarify matters.  (They already know the truth.  In any religious battle, the first rule is to never question the viewpoint you're defending.)\n",

      " In explaining the transistor effect, if we drill down through various ideas, we find a central concept:  when the base terminal injects charged particles into the base region, there is no way for the motion of those particles to influence the other charged particles being sent out by the emitter.  There is no mechanism by which the base charge-flow can directly affect the emitter's charge-flow.   Yet if we inject a tiny base current, we obtain a huge emitter current!  The hfe parameter is no illusion.  Base current obviously does control emitter current.  How?  It's because any change in Ib absolutely requires a change in Vbe... and Ie is determined by Vbe because Vbe determines the thickness of the depletion layer.   Base current can control emitter current through a multi-step process involving Vbe and the depletion layer.  Charged particles injected by the base do in fact influence the charged particles sent out by the emitter.  They just can't do it directly.\n",

      " So is a transistor controlled by current?  Yes, if by \"\"controlled,\"\" we mean that the emitter current can be changed by changing the base current.  Is it \"\"controlled\"\" by voltage?  Yes, if by \"\"controlled\"\" we mean that the emitter current can be changed by changing the value of Vbe.  And those people who choose one side or the other can fight forever about the \"\"right answer.\"\"  They'll almost come to blows over the One True Path to transistor enlightenment, since their own viewpoint is obviously good and true and right, while the opposing side are all a bunch of worshippers of Darkness and Confusion whose blasphemy must be ridiculed.  After all, young students could be misled from the One True Path!  Think of the children!  )\n",

      "After taking a look through some old notes, I think I noticed that the only time that a \"\"heel\"\" won the major championship of the WWE from a \"\"face\"\" at any WrestlaMania is at the 1999 WrestleMania, when Steve Austin won it from The Rock.   In any version of the major championship {WWE Championship, World Heavyweight Championship), the only time I remember seeing the \"\"heel\"\" leave the major championship match of WrestleMania as the champion is only when he entered the match as the defending champion (such as Chris Jericho successfully defending against Edge in 2010, and the Miz successfully defending against John Cena in 2011). Otherwise, the \"\"face\"\" typically wins the major championship match, especially when the face is the defending champion.\n",
      "This may just be speculation, but probably the reason that Steve Austin as the \"\"heel\"\" got to win the WWE Championship at WrestleMania 15 is because it was held in his home state of Texas. ..\n",
      ".. So, this major championship match of WrestleMania 30 should be quite interesting in the way it unfolds, as there are two possibilities; if in the Bryan/HHH match, Triple H were to win, the triple threat major championship match would have all three participants as \"\"heels\"\", including the champion Randy Orton, making it so that no matter who wins, the champion would be heel regardless of who the champion is, barring a \"\"face turn\"\". On the other hand, if in the Bryan/HHH match, Daniel Bryan were to win, the triple threat major championship match would have two heels including the champion Randy Orton, and one face, obviously being Daniel Bryan - and if that's the case, with the history being the way it is with this sort of thing, they would almost assuredly mean they would have to have Daniel Bryan win the big championship match, as WrestleMania history usually dictates. Although, we never know how they might possible go against their own history. Plus, there's no telling whether they will even have Daniel Bryan defeat Triple H to get into the triple threat match at all. \n",
      " \n",
      "But they could surprise everyone and have the championship match end up being a fatal-four-way match, in which case anything could happen. But I think the majority of us might agree that the one least likely to come out of the championship match with the championship is Batista; he's the only one of the four guys to disappear before long, since he hasn't been there. But also, being that Randy Orton is the \"\"heel\"\" and that he's had the championship since October, he too isn't likely to be the champion after that match. So, if we were putting odds on it, all historical facts considered, the two most likely to have the championship after that match (be it a triple threat or fatal four way, if that were to happen) is either Daniel Bryan or Triple H - Daniel Bryan because he can be the hero of WrestleMania as the good guy, or Triple H because he hasn't had the championship in five years and because he's the boss.\n",
      "But as I say, to my recollection, only in 1999 did a heel win the major championship at WrestleMania.   \"\n",

He does not want the word \"\"democracy\"\".

He added the additional data at the top of the page only in an act of revenge and to cover up the 'eternity clause' article. And again he focused on the word \"\"constition\"\" at the top of his changes. And when I told him he had wrongfully duplicated the \"\"entrenched clause\"\" and again was wrongfully pushing the word \"\"constitution\"\" (which Germany does not have), he then added \"\"Basic Law\"\" to his change. Then several editors suddently (for the first time) showed up and one of them deleted the entire 'eternity clause' article, leaving only what Lone boatman had put in. Wikipedia is apparently no place to safeguard an article, even a properly referenced article, which it was.

By the 4th century bc, it had extended its rule northward into the Balkan Peninsula and throughout the Mediterranean. In the 2nd century bc, Macedonia was made into a Roman province. When the Roman Empire was divided in the 4th century ad into eastern and western halves, Macedonia became part of the eastern half, which became the Byzantine Empire. By this time the population of Macedonia had been largely Christianized.

The growth of Macedonia forced the remaining Paeonians northward, and in 358 bc they were defeated by Philip II of Macedonia. The native dynasty, however, continued to be highly respected: about 289 bc, King Audoleon received Athenian citizenship, and his daughter married Pyrrhus, king of Epirus.
